## Features

- ✅ **Personalized hydration goals.**  
    Set your daily water consumption goal right in the Django admin or through the **Telegram /start command`.

- ✅ **Smart notification scheduling**  
    Choose your first and last reminder times, so h2oh! only nudges you when it makes sense.

- ✅ Flexible reminder flow  
    When the bot reminds you to drink, you can reply with:
    - "Done!" – mark your progress for the day.
    - "Remind me later!" – delay the next reminder by a configurable amount of time.

- ✅ **Simple progress tracking**
    Log drinks directly from Telegram with `/hydrate`, or tap "Done! 💧" when prompted — your daily stats are stored automatically.
